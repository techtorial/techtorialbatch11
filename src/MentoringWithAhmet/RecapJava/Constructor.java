    INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    1)What is constructor and what do you do with it ?
       ** Constructor is a way to initiliaze the instance variables.
       ** Assign the values to the new object.
    2)Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method?
    CONSTRUCTOR:
    *doesn't have return type
    *must have same name of the class
    METHODS:
    *it has return types
    *Methods might have or not same name of the class.

    3)Can you make the constructor private?
    SIR/MADAM you cannot make the constructor not only PRIVATE also static and FINAL and ABSTRACT.
    *****BUT IN MY TESTING I AM USING SINGLETON PATTERN DESIGN WHICH IS A SPECIAL CLASS THAT
    LIMIT PEOPLE TO ACCESS YOUR DATA.
    4)What is the difference between this,this(),super,super().
    this keyword in JAVA: this means refers to instance variables and methods.
    this()-->To call another constructor in the SAME CLASS.
    *it has to be in the first line of the code.
    super--> super means refers to parent instance variables and methods.
    super()-->to call the constructor from PARENT CLASS.
