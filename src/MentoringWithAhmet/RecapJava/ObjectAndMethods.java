    INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    FACEBOOK:
    1)What is object? and tell me about its methods ?(2-3)
    -Object is a presentation of the class.
    -There are many methods but I used

    #.equals-> which is comparison
    #.Hashcode-->memory location of the data
    #.toString--> it shows the all the variable in  a string mode.
    2)What is the difference between object and class?
    OBJECT AND CLASS:
    CLASS : is a blue print/template which you can create as many objects as you like
    OBJECT: is a member or instance of a class.
    OBJECT: You can create as many as you want to have
    CLASS:one class.
    OBJECT: is decleared with NEW keyword.
    CLASS: is decleared CLASS keyword
    3)How do you initiliaze the instance variables?
    There are different ways to initiliaze the instance variables. I mostly used
    *Constructor
    Methods(Setters)
    *Create an object
    Directly assing the
    Integer;
    Double;



    //TASK 1:
You are a business owner who owns several grocery stores.
All of your stores sell apples and oranges
Create a class called groceryStore. In this class,create 4 member variables
for the following information.Use your own creative variable names.

number of apples sold per year
retail price of each apple
number of oranges sold per year
retail price of each orange

Create 2 objects of the groceryStore into the GroceryStoreTest(main method inside
houstonStore
seattleStore


//TASK 2
Add additional code to the last exercise dealing with the groceryStore class
Store values into the instance variables as follows:
For the Houston Store: IN TEST CLASS
number of apple sold per year=534
retail price of each apple=0.99
number of oranges sold per year=429
retail price of each orange=0.87

For the Seattle Store:
number of apples sold per year =765
retail price of each apple=0.86
number of oranges sold per year=842
retail price of each orange=0.91


Output all of this info for the HOUSTON
store to the screen in an organized way, for example:

Houston Store:
Apples sold - 534
Apple retail cost - $0.99

Oranges sold-429
Orange retail cost - $0.87


**TASK 3:
Create a method named grossRevenue and add it to the
Print this information on the screen
output: The revenue of the Houston is amount
        The revenue of the Seattle is amount
groceryStore class that calculates the gross revenue of the store
then print the results to the screen
Back in the main method, call the grossRevenue method for each of the two stores
At the end, i would like to see gross revenue of each store printed on the screen

**TASK 5:
Modify the code from the previous exercise so that grossRevenue method
in the groceryStore class calculates the gross revenue and returns the
caller. In other words, don't have to the method print out the answer.
It should calculate the answer and return it to the calling place in the main
method

**TASK 6:
Alter the GroceryStore Class to a constructor that will take
information
on apples and oranges and assign these numbers to the instance
variables
Then,call the method grossRevenue and use it to print out the
revenue for each store
